poland.13.t:0 "A Job For Every Pole"
poland.13.d:0 "If we are to ensure that the polish people have the best life possible, there must be no foreigners in the factories. If the foreigners aren't there, then the poles will get more money, and become more prosperous."
poland.13.a:0 "It's the right choice"
poland.14.t:0 "Monitored labor"
poland.14.d:0 "In order to ensure maximum efficiency, we must monitor our workers. Guards will make sure that the workers do not have unnecessary breaks, and slack. Experts are claiming that one guard per ten worker is enough, however the higher-ups in the Falanga are saying that one guard per five workers should do the work. No matter any disagreements this can only lead to more progress."
poland.14.a:0 "Most necessary"
poland.15.t:0 "Work Harder, Not Smarter"
poland.15.d:0 "The brilliant minds at the ministry of economic affairs, invented the idea of 'Work Harder, Not Smarter'. The workers shouldn't try to figure out faster and easier ways to solve a task. The longer we can keep them in the factory, the better."
poland.15.a:0 "Why didn't we think of this before"
poland.16.t:0 "Forbid Unemployment"
poland.16.d:0 "If we forbid the concept of 'unemployment' in the polish society, we will lower unemployment. Every pole shall have a job. No matter gender, age or whatever diseases they have, they will come to the factory."
poland.16.a:0 "Yes yes yes"
poland.17.t:0 "Decrease the Payment"
poland.17.d:0 "The perfect combination. Increasing the hours, and decreasing the payment. The workers will work longer, and we will have to pay them less."
poland.17.a:0 "The Perfect Idea"
poland.18.t:0 "No Sick Days"
poland.18.d:0 "if we remove the idea of 'sick days' we can produce even more in our factories. If the workers complain, the guards will just 'take care of them'. They can't complain if they aren't there."
poland.18.a:0 "No More Luxury!"
poland.19.t:0 "Only Poles In The Factories"
poland.19.d:0 "The poles are among some of the best in the world. And polish products are among the top tier products of quality in the world. Why should we let filthy foreigners work on polish products. They will infect the with their lice and diseases, and the products will be worthless"
poland.19.a:0 "No Ukranians, No Romanians"
poland.20.t:0 "Labor Lottery"
poland.20.d:0 "Today came a message from the ministry of economic affairs. The ministers came up with the idea of a 'Labor Lottery'. A monthly lottery where the winner gets a new, very prestigious, job. The tickets cost a lot, so the job will also pay alot. The one thing the peasants don't know is that the jobs aren't that prestigious, and that they will often have to move far away to work. Through this scheme, we can only do one thing, and that is earn a lot of money."
poland.20.a:0 "Nothing bad can come out of this, right?"
poland.21.t:0 "Never CLose The Factories"
poland.21.d:0 "If we keep the factories open at all times, we will constantly produce new products. We will have a day team and a night team, that take 12 hours each."
poland.21.a:0 "More Money"
